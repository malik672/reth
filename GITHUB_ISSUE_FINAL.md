# Storage Worker Thread Count Should Adapt to Page Fault Rate

## Problem

The default storage worker thread count uses a static formula that doesn't account for actual workload characteristics:

```rust
// crates/engine/primitives/src/config.rs:13-16
fn default_storage_worker_count() -> usize {
    std::thread::available_parallelism()
        .map(|n| (n.get() * 2).clamp(2, 64))
        .unwrap_or(8)
}
```

**Formula:** `(CPU_cores * 2).clamp(2, 64)`

This creates a one-size-fits-all approach that can be:
- **Wasteful** on systems with sufficient RAM (uses 64 threads for minimal paging)
- **Insufficient** on systems with heavy paging (64 threads might not be enough)

## Real-World Context

### Mainnet Ethereum on 256GB Machine

**State size breakdown:**
- Hashed tables: ~130GB
- Trie tables: ~37GB
- Plain state: ~130GB
- **Total: ~297GB** (exceeds 256GB RAM by 41GB)

**Observed behavior:**
- Continuous page faults: **36k/sec** (constant)
- This is inevitable given state > RAM
- Each page fault blocks a thread for ~1-10ms (disk I/O)
- Extra threads help by allowing others to proceed while some are blocked on I/O

### Different Scenarios Need Different Thread Counts

| Scenario | State | RAM | Page Faults | Optimal Threads | Current Formula | Issue |
|----------|-------|-----|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| Mainnet on 256GB | 297GB | 256GB | 36k+/sec | 64-128 | 64 | Maybe insufficient |
| Mainnet on 512GB | 297GB | 512GB | <1k/sec | 16-32 | 64 | Wasteful (extra context switching) |
| Small chain | 10GB | 32GB | ~0/sec | 8-16 | 16-64 | Wasteful (wastes memory) |
| Dev/test | <1GB | 8GB | ~0/sec | 4-8 | 16 | Wasteful (wastes memory) |

## Root Cause

The Linux scheduler must manage threads in the run queue. With 64 threads on a 32-core machine:

**When page faults are FREQUENT (36k/sec):**
- Threads regularly block on I/O
- Not all threads compete for CPU simultaneously
- Extra threads help by providing more work to do while others wait
- 64 threads is justified

**When page faults are RARE (<1k/sec):**
- Most threads are runnable (competing for CPU)
- 64 threads on 32 cores = excessive context switching
- Each context switch = ~1-10µs overhead
- Only ~32 threads needed

**The formula can't distinguish between these cases.**

---

## Proposed Solution: Adaptive Thread Scaling

Measure actual page fault rate during node operation and adjust thread count accordingly:

```rust
fn calculate_worker_threads() -> usize {
    let page_faults_per_sec = measure_page_faults_linux();

    match page_faults_per_sec {
        // Minimal paging: system has plenty of RAM
        faults if faults < 1000 => {
            std::thread::available_parallelism()
                .map(|n| n.get())
                .unwrap_or(8)
        }
        // Moderate paging: use current formula
        faults if faults < 50000 => {
            std::thread::available_parallelism()
                .map(|n| (n.get() * 2).clamp(2, 64))
                .unwrap_or(8)
        }
        // Heavy paging: increase threads to hide I/O latency
        _ => {
            std::thread::available_parallelism()
                .map(|n| (n.get() * 3).clamp(16, 128))
                .unwrap_or(16)
        }
    }
}

fn measure_page_faults_linux() -> u64 {
    // Read from /proc/vmstat on Linux
    // Example: grep "pgfault" /proc/vmstat
    // Calculate faults/sec from kernel metrics
    // Fallback to current formula on non-Linux
}
```

### Why This Works

1. **On high-paging systems** (like Mainnet 256GB): Automatically detects 36k+/sec faults → uses 64+ threads to hide latency
2. **On low-paging systems**: Automatically detects <1k/sec faults → uses num_cores threads (no waste)
3. **No operator configuration needed**: System tunes itself
4. **Optimal for all hardware**: Works equally well on 8-core or 64-core machines

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Add Measurement (Minimal)

```rust
// crates/engine/primitives/src/config.rs

#[cfg(target_os = "linux")]
fn get_page_fault_rate() -> Option<u64> {
    use std::fs;

    // Read /proc/vmstat
    let vmstat = fs::read_to_string("/proc/vmstat").ok()?;

    // Parse pgfault counter
    // Return faults/sec (averaged over sample period)
    // This is a simple read - kernel provides cumulative count
    // Real implementation would track deltas over time

    Some(36000) // Example from Mainnet
}

#[cfg(not(target_os = "linux"))]
fn get_page_fault_rate() -> Option<u64> {
    None  // Fallback to current formula on non-Linux
}
```

### Phase 2: Adaptive Calculation

Update `default_storage_worker_count()` to use page fault rate

### Phase 3: Monitoring

Add metrics to track which branch is being used and why

## Benefits

### For Mainnet Operators (256GB machine)

**Before:** 64 threads, no way to increase if needed
**After:** System detects 36k/sec faults, automatically uses 64+ threads

### For Small Chain Operators

**Before:** 64 threads (wastes memory and scheduler cycles)
**After:** System detects <1k/sec faults, uses 8-16 threads

### For Infrastructure

**Before:** Same formula everywhere (doesn't scale)
**After:** Automatically adapts to actual hardware constraints

---

## Technical Considerations

### Page Fault Measurement

**Linux (`/proc/vmstat`):**
```
pgfault: Total page faults (major + minor)
pgmajfault: Major page faults (required disk I/O)
pswpin: Memory paged in from swap
pswpout: Memory paged out to swap
```

**For our purposes:** Track `pgfault` rate to detect paging pressure

### Fallback Behavior

- **Non-Linux systems:** Use current formula (can't measure page faults)
- **If measurement fails:** Use current formula (safe default)
- **If measurement is stale:** Use last known value (within refresh interval)

### Performance Impact

- Reading `/proc/vmstat` is lightweight (~1KB read, microseconds)
- Can be done once on startup or periodically (e.g., every 10 seconds)
- Calculation is simple math, negligible overhead

---

## Real-World Impact

### Mainnet on 256GB (YOUR DATA)

Current: 64 threads (fixed)
Proposed: Detects 36k/sec faults → uses 64 threads ✓ Correct

On a different 256GB machine with less-used Mainnet data:
Current: 64 threads (fixed)
Proposed: Detects 2k/sec faults → uses 32 threads ✓ Better

### Dev Environments

Current: 64 threads (wasteful)
Proposed: Detects <100/sec faults → uses 8 threads ✓ Much better

---

## Migration Path

### Immediate (No Breaking Changes)

1. Add `get_page_fault_rate()` function (Linux-only)
2. Update `default_storage_worker_count()` to use it
3. Fallback to current formula on non-Linux and if measurement fails
4. Add debug logging: `"Using X threads (detected Y faults/sec)"`

### Testing

- Linux: Verify measurement works and thresholds are reasonable
- Non-Linux: Verify fallback to current formula
- Different hardware: Verify scaling adapts correctly

### Documentation

- Explain the adaptive behavior
- Document the thresholds (1k, 50k)
- Show how to check page fault rate: `grep pgfault /proc/vmstat`

## Measurement Reference

For operators to understand their system:

```bash
# Check current page fault rate
cat /proc/vmstat | grep pgfault

# Monitor page faults in real-time
watch -n 1 'cat /proc/vmstat | grep -E "pgfault|pswpin"'

# Compare with network load
# Higher page faults during peak hours = memory-constrained

# Real-world example (Mainnet 256GB):
# pgfault 456000000  (total faults since boot)
# If measured over 12 hours: ~36,000 faults/sec average
```

---

## Summary

Rather than use a static formula, **measure actual page fault rate and adapt thread count dynamically**. This solves the problem for all scenarios:

- High-paging systems get enough threads to hide I/O latency
- Low-paging systems avoid wasting resources
- Different operators get optimal configuration without manual tuning

The system adapts to its actual constraints, not guessed-at averages.
